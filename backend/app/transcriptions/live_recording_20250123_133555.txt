 Listen to me.com accidents. I wonder how many accidents I have had in my life. I have a few serious ones where I have ended up in hospital. Traffic accidents are the worst. They are always painful. I have not had too many work related accidents. I suppose that's because I do office work and that's not so dangerous. Most of my accidents are those around the house. I have lost count of the number of the times I have hit my thumb with the hammer. I am also really good at standing up and hitting my head on something. I am not as bad as my friend though. He is a real accident looking for some bad happen. Almost every time we meet has some story to tell about his latest accident. He is quite unbelievable. I think I would be very worried if I were his mother.
