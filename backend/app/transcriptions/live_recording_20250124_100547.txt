 Hi there AI voice agent. Let's test how well you can understand me. I'm speaking at a normal pace but I will vary my tone and speed as I go. Can you accurately recognize punctuation like commands, periods, question marks or even exclamation points? Let's try some tricky words too like supercalifragilisticxprdoses or onometopia. Oh and don't forget numbers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 and dates like January 24, 25, 2025. Finally let's include a question. How are you performing so far?
