 Unit 2, Page 20, Conversation Listening. Conversation 1. How many people are in your family? There are five people in my family. My parents and my older sister and my younger brother. Younger brother? What's he like? Like? Wow, that's a tough question. I don't know, he's some... A cool guy? No, definitely not cool. I'd say he's average, a typical teenager. Is he tall? Tall? Um, he's not so tall, same height as me. Handsome like me? You're not handsome, and he's not handsome, he's just average. Yeah. Conversation 2. You said your grandmother lives with you. Yes, I love her so much. She's always doing nice things for me. She's so sweet. How would you describe her? What does she look like? Look like? That's an easy question. She's slender and pretty. Pretty? Yeah, she was an actress when she was young and she did some modeling. Cool! And what does she do now? Well, she's not, um, she's very active. Always busy with her friends, doing things to help people. I think she has a job or is doing some volunteer work or something. I think we expect grandmothers to be doing quiet things, like reading books or just watching TV. But that's not my grandmother at all. Conversation 3. Me and my sister. So there are just the four of us. Do you get along with your sister? Do I get along with... wow, that's a difficult question. Really? Why? Well, she's older. Two years older and she's really a good student. Makes good grades. Always winning this contest or that competition. So she gets attention. Yes, that's it. Mom and dad just like her better, I think. No, no, no, no, don't say that. I know. I shouldn't say that. Maybe I'm a little bit jealous. She doesn't even work hard. I have to work harder. Much harder to study than she does. Conversation 4. Do you see your dad very much? Yeah, he doesn't work late every night like other fathers do. He's usually at home the same time every night. Do you look like him or your mother? That's an interesting question. He's bald, but I have hair, so we don't look like that much. But I mean, you know... Yeah, I think I look like my mother. She has small eyes and so do I. And we have the same nose. So you look like your mom. Look like my mom, but I have my dad's personality. He's funny.
